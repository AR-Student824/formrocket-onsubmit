# FormRocket OnDone Handler
Handler for certain FormRocket OnDone routes 

## Currently covers
- Success messages (with custom messages)

## Info
- This is the only official ondone handler for FormRocket, I'm not sure how you'd make an unofficial one anyway
- This is the Handler for what to show when a fork is submitted, not FormRocket itself, its repo is on this account as formrocket
- Hosted on replit by my friend.
